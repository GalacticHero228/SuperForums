# SuperForums

This is a new, clean forum built on a foundation of Python, Django and Bootstrap4.
This is a project to display my abilities in working cleanly in both the front and backend of web application development.

SuperForums is my first serious project using the Python/Django framework. 
While I have used Bootstrap3 many times in the past, this is also my first interaction with Bootstrap4.
Although many things have changed, I am fairly adaptable and got going with ease after checking with the documentation.

SuperForums is a working project and will continue to grow over time.
